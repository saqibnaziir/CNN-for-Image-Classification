# CNN-for-Image-Classification
This script is writtern for image classification using Convolution Neural Network. You can train your own dataset on this model as well.  
CNNs have broken the mold and ascended the throne to become the state-of-the-art computer vision technique. 
Among the different types of neural networks (others include recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), 
artificial neural networks (ANN), etc.), CNNs are easily the most popular.
